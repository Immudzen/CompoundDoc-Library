This library is used by CompoundDoc and it has functions that are common between
CompoundDoc and our websites. I am hoping these functions will be useful to others.

Right now most of the stuff is pretty simple. There are some nice functions for generating
javascript, catalog traversal safely, loading an individual record safely.

There are a lot of things that I will be added to this over time to make it a much better
library for building websites more rapidly.

The goal is not to allow every feature of the javascript libraries that I am wrapping. The
goal is to make it so that the normal usage is as simple as possible and requires as little
code as possible.
